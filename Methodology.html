<section id="why-adjacency">
<h2>Why Adjacency?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-adjacency" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This package aims to answer a seemingly simply question: when are two things adjacent?</p>
<p>One definition of adjacency requires geometries to actually touch; if two geometries
intersect, then they’re adjacent. This is great for some applications, like determining which
countries are adjacent to one other.</p>
<p>But real geospatial data often has gaps between features. How, for example,  do we account for island
countries? England and France are generally considered to be adjacent, but they don’t intersect.
Adjacency in a case like this matters a great deal. Consider how different history and politics
would be if these two countries actually shared a land border, or if they were nearby, but with some
other country in between?</p>
<p>When it comes to spatial analysis, you can sometimes get away with an intersection to answer a
question of adjacency. But that only works with perfect data, where all features are perfectly
tiled across the plane, with no gaps in between. In reality, data is often rife with imperfections,
and simple intersections, or proximity calculations won’t answer the important questions.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>This definition somewhat differs from another geometric concept of adjacency, in which adjacent
geometries must be either touching, or share a corner. See this article for more: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog586/taxonomy/term/264">https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog586/taxonomy/term/264</a></p>

<section id="imperfect-solutions">
<h2>Imperfect Solutions<a class="headerlink" href="#imperfect-solutions" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>A adjacency analysis must take gaps between features into account. Simplistically, this could be
accomplished with ray-casting: you could send a ray out from every source towards every target,
and get if the ray intersects with any obstacles in between. But this doesn’t always make sense.
Take the example below:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="_images/AdjacencyRaycast.png" src="_images/AdjacencyRaycast.png" />
</div></blockquote>
<p>A ray cast from Geometry A will reach Geometry B some of the time, but clearly they are not adjacent,
because Geometry C interferes.</p>
<p>We could tweak the scenario slightly, and give the two geometries a full line of sight. In other words,
A ray cast from any point to any other point would have a clear path.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="_images/AdjacencyRaycast2.png" src="_images/AdjacencyRaycast2.png" />
</div></blockquote>
<p>But are these two geometries really adjacent? Maybe. This is the grey area that gets to the heart of
why this problem is so difficult to define, much less solve.</p>
</section>
<section id="voronoi-adjacency">
<h2>Voronoi Adjacency<a class="headerlink" href="#voronoi-adjacency" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>What we really need is a way to erase the gaps between the geometries. If we could only slowly expand
each geometry, as though inflating a series of balloons in a box, eventually they would touch, and
we could do a simple intersection. That would solve our adjacency problem in a deterministic,
objective way. Luckily, we have a way to do just that.</p>
<p>A Voronoi diagram is defined like this, according to the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.qhull.org/html/qvoronoi.htm">QHull</a>  library (upon which <cite>geo-adjacency</cite> relies).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Voronoi diagram is the nearest-neighbor map for a set of points. Each region contains those
points that are nearer one input site than any other input site.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Another way of thinking of it is to imagine a bubble slowly expanding outwards from each input point,
until the bubbles bump into one another, filling the space and creating frontiers between regions.</p>
<p>In this package, <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.Voronoi.html">scipy.spatial.Voronoi</a>
provides an interface to QHull, a C library which can calculate the diagram very quickly.</p>
<p>In this package, we say that two geometries are adjacent if their Voronoi regions intersect. That’s
it! It’s a simple, but powerful concept.</p>
<p>It’s actually even simpler than that; we don’t even need to check the regions for intersection.
QHull will tell us the vertices that make up the Voronoi regions, and which input points were used
to generate them. If two input points share a Voronoi vertex, then their Voronoi regions by
definition must intersect.</p>
<p>This optimization is orders of magnitude faster than actually running
and intersection. As a result, the runtime of this package is almost entirely bound by the speed of
the QHull library’s Voronoi implementation, which is very fast.</p>
</section>
<section id="segmentization">
<h2>Segmentization<a class="headerlink" href="#segmentization" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>There’s a further problem, though: the Voronoi algorithm only works on points. What if our inputs
are polygons? How do we get a Voronoi diagram of a polygon?</p>
<p>Step one is obvious enough: Take the Voronoi diagram of all the vertices of each polygon, and union
the resulting regions. But what if our input polygon isn’t very detailed. A long rectangle, for example.
The Voronoi diagram would be based on only 4 points. What if there is an obstacle region somewhere
near the center of the rectangle’s long side? The Voronoi diagram would not account for this.</p>
<p>The solution is to add additional vertices to the input polygons until they are dense enough to produce
and accurate diagram.</p>
<p>Getting the right number of vertices takes a little bit of trial and error. If <cite>densify_features</cite> is
True, then the <cite>AdjacencyEngine</cite> will attempt to calculate a reasonable level of segmentization, as
Shapely calls is. This is based on the average segment length of all input features. This is sometimes
not enough, though, and it’s advisable to do some experimentation to find a level that generates an
accurate result, without compromising performance too much; every additional vertex makes the Voronoi
calculation a little more intensive.</p>
