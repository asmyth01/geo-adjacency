"""
The adjacency module is a part of the geo-adjacency package, which provides functionality for
calculating and analyzing adjacency between geometries. It implements the AdjacencyEngine class,
which allows users to determine adjacency relationships between a set of source and target
geometries, taking into account obstacles and a specified radius. The module utilizes the Voronoi
diagram to generate adjacency linkages and provides methods for plotting the adjacency linkages on
a map. The module also handles cases where there are gaps between features, ensuring accurate
adjacency analysis. Overall, the adjacency module enables users to answer questions about spatial
adjacency, providing valuable insights for geospatial analysis and decision-making processes.
