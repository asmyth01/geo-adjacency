"""
The `adjacency` module implements the AdjacencyEngine class,
which allows us to determine adjacency relationships. Adjacency relationships are between a set of source geometries,
 or between source geometries and a second set of target geometries. Obstacle geometries can be passed in to
 stand between sources or sources and targets, but they are not included in the output.

 For example, if we wanted to know what trees in a forest are adjacent to the shore of a lake, we could
 pass in a set of Point geometries to the trees, a Polygon to represent the lake, and a LineString to represent
 a road passing between some of the trees and the shore.

 `AdjacencyEngine` utilizes a Voronoi of all the vertices in all the geometries combined to determine
 which geomtries are adjacent to each other. See
