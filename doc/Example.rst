Building Footprints in Seattle
------------------------------

In this example, we'll create an adjacency analysis of of some building footprint data in an area
of Seattle near Gasworks Park. Footprint data is great for this demonstration because no two
features intersect. We'll use the free Microsoft building footprint dataset, available via ArcGIS
`here`_.

We'll also bring in a park polygon for Gasworks park, and also the road network so we can see how
different inputs can lead to different interpretations of adjacency.
